Running at this darkness
I can't hear a song
I am kind of nervous
Are you still around

I see someone coming
When I pass I see your face
It's now the time to tell you
Would it be in vain if I do explain

How I want you how I need you
You're so beautiful tonight
How I want you when I see you in the light
It's time since I have seen you
What we had was right let we try again tonight

I am often wondered have you called my name
Or was it just a morning for a little game
Can you still remember how you kissed my eyes and smiled
It's now the time to ask you
Would it be in vain if I do explain

How I want you how I need you
You're so beautiful tonight
How I want you when I see you in the light
It's time since I have seen you
What we had was right let we try again tonight.
